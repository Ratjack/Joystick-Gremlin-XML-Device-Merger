# Joystick Gremlin XML Device Merger

**Joystick Gremlin XML Device Merger** is a simple utility that helps you merge a device from one Joystick Gremlin profile to Another.  Instead of having to go in and copy and paste manually and picking the right device, this utility will list the devices in the file along with the number of containers helping identify the correct one.


It allows you to:
- View all available XML files in your folder
- Select a source XML file that contains the VKB device you want to copy
- Select a target XML profile to inject that device into
- Preview all detected devices (with name, GUID, and number of control containers)
- Write a clean merged XML file to use in Joystick Gremlin

## Note

This works best if your SEM is setup as a separate virtual controller.  To see how you can setup your SEM a virtual controller see the following YouTube video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VM-OoXhYvs&t=94s.  Alternatively I have included my saved CFG for my right stick where the SEM has been separated into a virtual device.


## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

When you launch the tool:
1. It lists all `.xml` files in the current folder
2. You choose a **source file** (containing the VKB device)
3. You choose a **target file** (usually your Gremlin profile)
4. You select which device to insert
5. A new file is created with ` (merged)` added to the filename

## üìÅ File Requirements

- Both the **source** and **target** `.xml` files **must be in the same folder** as this program.
- The program will only detect `.xml` files in the launch directory.
- Output files will also be written to the same folder.

## Use With Premade VKB Joystick Gremlin Profile

-Place your Joystick Gremlin profile or previously used one with your device in the folder
-Place new premade Joystick Gremlin profile in the same folder
-Run and select the source and target to bring your device in.
-If updating to a newly released profile, just load in your old one along with the newly release.
